## Key Accomplishments

1. **Fixed the immediate issue** - Resolved the syntax error that was preventing the extension from loading
2. **Simplified the approach** - Removed complex dialog context detection logic
3. **Created comprehensive documentation** - Provided detailed information about all three approaches to Zotero integration
4. **Defined clear implementation path** - Created detailed specification and implementation plan for the direct database connection approach
5. **Established testing framework** - Created comprehensive test plan to ensure quality implementation
6. **Maintained compatibility** - Ensured all existing functionality still works and tests pass

## Next Steps

The next phase of development should focus on implementing the direct database connection approach as outlined in:
1. `DIRECT_DB_SPECIFICATION.md` - Detailed technical specification
2. `IMMEDIATE_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` - Step-by-step implementation guide
3. `IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md` - Task-by-task implementation checklist
4. `TEST_PLAN.md` - Comprehensive testing strategy

This approach will provide a cleaner, more reliable implementation that:
- Connects directly to the Zotero database for efficient batch processing
- Eliminates UI selection complexities
- Processes the entire library rather than just selected items
- Offers better performance and reliability
- Provides a modular design that can support multiple data sources
